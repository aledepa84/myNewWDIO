Hi this is the test for shows up the skills that I have in QA Automationv about setting up
an automation project, writing automated test scripts, and using Git for version control.

For this case will be better to always do the next steps, in order to execute my project correctly:

This is do it on WebDriverio so better to have all setups about this you could check instalation on this link:

-->> https://webdriver.io/docs/gettingstarted/


First you need to Run the instalation over the Node.js so 
After clone repository please do execute this command::

·····················································
#npm install
·····················································

Then for execute these scripts also use this command::

······················································
#npx wdio run wdio.conf.js
······················································

Good luck and good success
